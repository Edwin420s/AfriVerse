## 🚨 Known Issues to Watch

### Issue 1: Node.js Version
- **Problem:** Some dependencies require Node 18+
- **Check:** `node --version`
- **Fix:** Install Node 18 or 20 LTS

### Issue 2: Python Version
- **Problem:** uAgents requires Python 3.10+
- **Check:** `python --version`
- **Fix:** Install Python 3.10+ and use `python3` command

### Issue 3: Docker Permissions
- **Problem:** Docker commands may require sudo on Linux
- **Fix:** Add user to docker group or use sudo

### Issue 4: Port Conflicts
- **Problem:** Ports 3000, 4000, 5432, 6379 may be in use
- **Check:** `netstat -ano | findstr :PORT` (Windows) or `lsof -i :PORT` (Mac/Linux)
- **Fix:** Stop conflicting services or change ports in config

### Issue 5: IPFS Rate Limits
- **Problem:** Pinata free tier has upload limits
- **Solution:** Use Web3.Storage as backup or upgrade Pinata

### Issue 6: OpenAI API Costs
- **Problem:** Whisper API requires paid OpenAI account
- **Solution:** Use HuggingFace transformers as fallback
