## 📚 Documentation Guide

### For Different Users

**If you want to...**

| Goal | Read This |
|------|-----------|
| Get project running quickly (1 hr) | `docs/QUICK_START_README.md` |
| Complete detailed setup (3-4 hrs) | `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` |
| Understand project status | `docs/PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md` |
| Prepare demo presentation | `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` |
| Learn technical architecture | `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` |
| Integrate with API | `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` |
| See action items | `docs/MISSING_FILES_CHECKLIST.md` |
| Get project overview | Root `README.md` |

## ⚠️ One Manual Step Required

**Issue:** The updated README has some duplicate old content after line 642 that needs removal.

**Quick Fix (30 seconds):**

1. Open `README.md` in your code editor
2. Go to line 642 (the closing `</div>` tag)
3. Delete everything after line 642
4. Save the file

**The README should end with:**
```markdown
[![Star on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Edwin420s/AfriVerse?style=social)]
[![Follow on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/Edwin420s?style=social)]

</div>
```

**Why this happened:** Due to Windows PowerShell command limitations, the automated cleanup didn't complete. Manual deletion is safer anyway.
