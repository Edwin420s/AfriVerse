## ⚡ QUICK START: Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Setup Environment (30 min)

**1.1 Smart Contracts `.env`**
```bash
cd smartcontracts
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `smartcontracts/.env` and add:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_metamask_private_key_here
LINEA_TESTNET_RPC=https://rpc.goerli.linea.build
LINEA_SCAN_API_KEY=optional_for_verification
```

**Get Private Key:**
1. Open MetaMask → Account Details → Export Private Key
2. Enter password → Copy key
3. ⚠️ **NEVER commit this to Git!**

**Get Testnet ETH (free):**
- Visit: https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/
- Connect wallet → Request testnet ETH

**1.2 Backend `.env`**
```bash
cd services/backend
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `services/backend/.env`:
```env
PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_from_pinata.cloud
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://afri:afri_pass@localhost:5432/afriverse"
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=will_update_after_deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=same_as_smartcontracts
```

**Get Pinata JWT:** https://pinata.cloud/ (free account)

**1.3 Frontend `.env.local`**
```bash
cd frontend
```

Create `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_PROVIDER=https://rpc.goerli.linea.build
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=59140
```

---

### Step 2: Deploy Smart Contracts (1-2 hours)

```bash
cd smartcontracts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Deploy to Linea Testnet
npm run deploy:testnet
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Deploying AfriVerse Smart Contracts...
ValidatorManager deployed to: 0xABCD...1234
CulturalToken deployed to: 0xEFGH...5678
UjuziRegistry deployed to: 0xIJKL...9012
✅ Deployment completed!
```

**Save Contract Addresses:**
1. Copy the three addresses from terminal
2. Update `services/backend/.env`:
   ```env
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourUjuziRegistryAddress
   ```
3. Save for README update in Step 3

**Verify Contracts (Optional):**
```bash
npm run verify:testnet
```

---

**"Cannot find module 'hardhat'"**
→ Run `npm install` in smartcontracts directory

**"IPFS upload failed"**
→ Check PINATA_JWT in backend/.env

**"Transaction failed"**
→ Verify you're on Linea Testnet in MetaMask (Chain ID: 59140)

**"Database connection error"**
→ Ensure PostgreSQL running: `DATABASE_URL` correct

## 💡 Why AfriVerse Wins

**Technical Excellence:**
- 7 technologies integrated (Next.js, Express, Solidity, MeTTa, IPFS, Python agents)
- Production-ready code, not prototype
- Clean architecture, well-tested

**Innovation:**
- First cultural preservation platform with symbolic AGI
- MeTTa reasoning enables knowledge inference, not just storage
- Autonomous agent pipeline for scalability

**Impact:**
- Solves cultural extinction crisis
- Democratizes AI training data
- Empowers underrepresented communities
- Aligns with Ben Goertzel's vision: "AGI for all"

**Differentiation:**
- Most projects: basic storage platforms
- AfriVerse: AGI reasoning + blockchain provenance + community economics
